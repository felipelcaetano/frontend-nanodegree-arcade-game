# Rules
    
Once you start the game, your main goal is to cross all the way up to the river avoiding being hit by the enemies (bugs) moving non stop.
Every time you cross all the way successfully you earn 100 points.
You also have 3 hit points. Every time you got hit by enemies you will lose 1 hit point. Reaching 0 hit points will be game over for you.

**Hurry Up and remember avoiding your foes!!**
